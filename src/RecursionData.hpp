/** A data structure used by RecursionGuard to detect unwanted recursion.
 *
 *  \note While RecursionData supports copy and move semantics both is
 *      constructors and assignment, a recursion data structure should never
 *      change instance.  One way to deal with this would have been to delete
 *      these operators but this would force users to manually implement copy
 *      and move semantics for their classes.  Therefore, RecursionData will
 *      always make a new data structure on copy, move or assignment, allowed
 *      default copy and move constructors/assignment operators to be created
 *      for classes using RecursionData.
